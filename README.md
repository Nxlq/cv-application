# React + Vite

This cv-application was created to gain comfortability and reinforce the knowledge of props, components, jsx and the concept of state in React.
The code is purely structured around these concepts.
Along the development process I was exposed to: the different ways to initialize a React app, ways to structure the apps folders/files,
components, props, jsx, useState, useRef, state batching, updating State represented as an object/array properly and not trying to mutate it,
the way React renders things, and much more..
